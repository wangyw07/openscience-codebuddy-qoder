# Initialize the Atlas Research Graph

## Overview

An Atlas **project** is this repo's research graph — the root that hypotheses,
experiments, training/eval runs, evidence, and decisions hang off. Creating (or
linking to an existing) graph is a one-command, dedupe-safe operation. It is
keyed off the **git repo**, not the opened folder, so a subfolder or a fresh
clone at a different path resolves to the **same** graph.

Run this skill when:
- The canvas shows "no graph for this project" / the folder isn't linked yet.
- The user asks to "initialize", "set up Atlas", or "start tracking" research.
- You are about to begin research work that should be recorded.

## Steps

1. **(Optional) Confirm the CLI is authenticated.**
   ```bash
   atlas doctor --format=json
   ```
   If it reports unavailable/unauthenticated, tell the user to run
   `openscience login` — the graph cannot be created without a session.

2. **Create or link the graph** (idempotent — safe to re-run; returns the
   existing graph if one already exists):
   ```bash
   openscience project init --format=json
   ```
   On success this prints `{"project_id":"<id>"}` and writes `.openscience/project.json`
   at the repo root so the canvas links to it immediately.

   On failure it prints `project_id: null` plus an `error` kind (and `host`,
   `status`, `message` when known). Relay the fix that matches the kind — do
   NOT guess or tell the user to re-login for a network problem:
   - `"unauthenticated"` — no session, or the backend rejected the saved key.
     Tell the user to run `openscience login`.
   - `"unreachable"` — the Atlas backend at the printed `host` could not be
     reached (network/DNS error or 5xx). The user IS logged in; suggest checking
     connectivity and any `OPENSCIENCE_API_BASE`/`SYNSC_API_BASE` override, then
     retrying — not re-authenticating.
   - `"plan"` — authenticated, but the account has no active Atlas plan. Point
     the user at https://app.syntheticsciences.ai/billing; include the
     backend `message` if present.
   - `"backend"` — anything else; show the backend's `status`/`message` verbatim.

3. **Confirm to the user.** Report the `project_id` and tell them the graph now
   shows in the canvas (Atlas pane). From here, milestones are recorded against
   this graph as the work progresses.

## Notes

- **Idempotent & dedupe-safe:** re-running never creates a duplicate; it returns
  the same graph for the same repo.
- **Repo-rooted:** run it from anywhere inside the repo — it resolves to the git
  top-level.
- **Do not** hand-edit `.openscience/project.json`; let `openscience project init` manage
  it (use `openscience project merge` to pick a canonical root if duplicates exist).

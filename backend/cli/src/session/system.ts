  /** When the user message begins with `/<name>` matching an installed

  export function slashSkillDirective(): string[] {
    return [
      `<slash-skill-invocation>
When the user message begins with /<name> and <name> matches an available
skill:

1. Your VERY FIRST output token must be the tool call to skill({name: "<name>"}).
2. Produce ZERO text before the tool call. No "I'll load", no "Loading X",
   no "Sure, let me consult X first", no acknowledgement of any kind.
3. After the tool returns, your next user-visible message is your direct
   response to the user's actual request (which may be implicit in just
   "/<name>" — in that case ask what they want, but ONLY after the tool
   returns, never before).

FORBIDDEN outputs before the skill tool call (these are all wrong):
  ❌ "I'll load the caveman skill as requested."
  ❌ "Let me consult the caveman skill first."
  ❌ "Loading caveman..."
  ❌ "Sure, I'll use that skill."

CORRECT pattern:
  [no text]
  → skill({name: "caveman"}) tool call
  → tool result lands
  → [now you may speak, using the loaded skill's voice]

If <name> is NOT a known skill, treat the / as literal text and respond
normally.

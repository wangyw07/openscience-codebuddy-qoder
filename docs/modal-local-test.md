# Test Modal locally

## Build and launch

From the repository root:

```bash
bun run build --single
./backend/cli/dist/@synsci/openscience-linux-x64/bin/openscience web . --print-logs
```

On another platform, use the matching directory under `backend/cli/dist/@synsci/`.

## Connect Modal

1. Create a token in Modal with `modal token new` if you do not already have one.
2. Open **Settings → Compute → Modal**.
3. If the panel reports that `~/.modal.toml` is ready, select **configure**. OpenScience records the file as the credential source and enables Modal without copying its token values.
4. If there is no usable active profile, enter the token ID and secret separately, save them, and turn **Enable Modal** on.
5. Select **test connection**. A successful check reports the JavaScript SDK version.
6. Keep the default `python:3.12-slim` image, blocked network, and a short timeout for the smoke test.
7. Set **Concurrent jobs** to the maximum number of Modal sandboxes OpenScience may dispatch for this project at once.

OpenScience follows Modal's active-profile convention: the selected TOML table must contain `active = true`, `token_id`, and `token_secret`. It exposes only `found`/`ready` state to the UI. The trusted adapter reads credentials only after Modal is enabled and only for Modal control-plane operations.

Saving a token manually is inert. Enabling Modal permits the trusted adapter to decrypt it. Regardless of credential source, the token is never added to agent, shell, kernel, or remote job environments. Turning Modal off blocks credential resolution, new plans, and dispatches; it does not silently terminate a run that was already approved.

## Agent dispatch boundary

The agent can prepare ordinary project files and call the first-class `modal` tool, but it cannot approve its own run. A `yes` reply in chat is not dispatch authorization. The tool displays a one-run approval card where the app, image, Python packages, GPU, network policy, timeout, uploads, outputs, and paid-run warning are bound to a digest before **Dispatch** becomes available. The job then appears under **Compute → Jobs**; the user does not need to recreate it there.

Commands run inside the configured sandbox image. Use commands such as `python analysis.py`, list `analysis.py` under uploads, and provide third-party requirements in the tool's packages field. Do not use `modal run`, install the Modal Python SDK, or write a Modal-decorated application for this path; OpenScience's JavaScript adapter builds and governs the sandbox.

## Run the smoke job

Open a session in a trusted project, then open **Compute → Jobs → New job** and enter:

- Run location: `Modal`
- GPU type: `T4`
- Command:

  ```bash
  nvidia-smi && mkdir -p outputs && printf 'modal-smoke-ok\n' > outputs/modal-smoke.txt
  ```

- Under **Resources and reproducibility**, set a short time limit such as `10` minutes.
- Files to capture: `outputs/modal-smoke.txt`
- Files to upload: leave empty.

Select **Review command**. Verify the app, image, GPU, network policy, timeout, uploads, and paid-run warning. **Dispatch** is bound to that exact digest; changing any governed field requires another review.

A successful run should show `nvidia-smi` in the streamed log and copy `outputs/modal-smoke.txt` into the project with its checksum in **Captured outputs**.

Every governed job mounts a named per-job Modal Volume at `/workspace`. The volume name is recorded with the job without exposing the local project path. After the execution sandbox exits, OpenScience reads the command result and declared outputs directly through Modal's control-plane Volume API. It does not create a harvest sandbox. The Volume is deleted only after local delivery succeeds.

If local output delivery fails, the finished run remains visible with **Retry delivery**. That action reattaches to a live execution sandbox when necessary or reads the retained Volume directly; it does not rerun the approved command. **Clear finished** keeps the record until delivery succeeds or the retained resource is explicitly cleaned up.

To test cancellation, dispatch `sleep 300`, wait for the job to become running, then select **Cancel job**. Modal should terminate the tagged sandbox and the job should become cancelled.

If Modal does not confirm termination, the run remains visible with an explicit billing warning and **Retry cleanup**. Finished records whose remote resource is unknown or still holds recoverable output are not removed by **Clear finished**.

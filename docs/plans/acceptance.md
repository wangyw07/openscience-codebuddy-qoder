## Active runtime milestone: enforcing access broker

- Filesystem authority now has four explicit durable scopes: one request, one
  session, one project, or the whole installation. The permission card's
  `Always` response materializes as installation authority instead of silently
  narrowing to the current project.
- Session snapshots merge session, project, and installation grants into one
  monotonic authority revision. Read grants remain read-only, write grants
  authorize brokered writes only, and external folders never become writable
  Bash, Python, R, notebook, or job mounts.
- Canonical path checks reject traversal and symlink escapes. Managed session
  scratch remains private even when a broader folder scope is requested.
- Grant creation, one-shot consumption, and revocation publish an awaited
  authority change. Session changes stop that session's terminals, kernels,
  and jobs; project changes stop every project session; installation changes
  propagate across every live project instance and stop all affected work.
- Files exposes the installation scope as the explicit
  `Always — every project` choice and labels active grants by their real scope.
- Plan mode continues to block the complete side-effecting tool dispatch
  envelope, and process startup remains fail-closed when the required sandbox
  is unavailable.

### Local evidence

- The filesystem suite passes 17 tests, including directional access,
  one-shot consumption, cross-session and cross-project isolation, project and
  installation persistence, symlink denial, broker-only external writes, and
  revocation.
- A live integration test starts real sandboxed jobs in two simultaneously
  loaded projects and proves that an installation authority change cancels
  both process trees.
- The complete backend suite passes with 1,651 tests and one skip. The
  workspace source suite passes with 423 tests and 12 skips.
- Repository typecheck, regenerated OpenAPI/JavaScript SDK contracts, and the
  production workspace build pass. Browser and packaged test-channel gates
  remain before this row is verified.

## Active runtime milestone: durable session workspaces

- Every new managed session owns a durable workspace record with a stable ID,
  immutable project/session ownership, exact scratch root, isolated/legacy
  mode, active/stopped/trash state, grant revision, timestamps, and byte size.
- New isolated scratch lives under the OpenScience data root at
  `workspaces/<project_id>/<session_id>` and remains separate from the
  compatibility project directory.
- Existing filesystem-authority records lazily acquire a workspace record
  without moving or losing their bytes. Opaque-project migration moves the
  workspace record with the session and preserves its stable workspace ID.
- Session deletion moves isolated scratch to internal recoverable trash rather
  than deleting it. Restore is idempotent, keeps the same workspace/root
  identity, and preserves bytes; only trash older than seven days is purged.
- Legacy folder sessions retain their explicit `legacy` label and their host
  folder is never moved or deleted by workspace lifecycle operations.

### Local evidence

- 45 focused project/session/filesystem/execution-authority tests pass,
  including distinct roots, cross-session denial, lazy record migration,
  opaque-project migration, recoverable trash, idempotent restore, seven-day
  purge, legacy retention, and Bash/Python/R scratch ownership.
- Backend typecheck and regenerated SDK contracts pass. Broader runtime,
  workspace, browser, and packaged gates remain before this row is verified.

## Current milestone: immutable local artifacts and coherent Files

- Explicit saves stream exact bytes into a SQLite/WAL-backed local store
  instead of loading and base64-expanding binary files.
- The store writes content-addressed blobs outside session scratch and keeps
  immutable versions, a current-version pointer, source session/message fields,
  capture quality, and an optional execution record.
- A repeated save of one source creates the next version; identical content
  reuses one blob. Concurrent saves serialize without overwriting a version.
- Each version is capped at 1 GiB and saves preserve a 1 GiB free-space reserve.
- Files distinguishes writable session files, durable artifacts, and connected
  folders. The Artifact list comes from the durable store rather than a project
  directory scan.
- Saved artifacts reopen from their immutable blob even when the source file is
  gone. Preview, Versions, How made, Review, and exact Download are separate
  actions, and missing execution/review evidence is stated rather than inferred.
- Renaming changes only record metadata. Delete moves the artifact and all
  versions to recoverable Trash; Restore returns it to Files, and trash older
  than 30 days removes only blobs no remaining version references.
- Review binds one selected version to a project-owned provenance target whose
  identity includes the immutable version ID and SHA-256. The dedicated
  artifact reviewer receives only `artifact_snapshot`, `provenance_query`, and
  append-only `provenance_review`; live workspace reads, commands, skills, and
  mutation tools are absent.
- `artifact_snapshot` revalidates project ownership, version ID, byte count, and
  hash before returning paged text or an exact image/PDF attachment. Unsupported
  binary formats produce an explicit no-verdict limitation.
- The saved artifact Review tab requests the selected artifact/version pair,
  verifies the server-confirmed target and hash, and displays only findings
  linked to that target. A launch or failed model run is never presented as a
  scientific pass.

### Local evidence

- Explicit-save route tests cover text, raw binary, 6 MiB streaming, the 1 GiB
  boundary, path containment, deduplication, source deletion, concurrent saves,
  list/detail, immutable raw reads, hashes, and missing files.
- The backend suite passes with 1,646 tests and one skip. The workspace source
  suite passes with 423 tests and 12 skips.
- Repository typecheck and the production workspace build pass.
- Browser walkthrough proves a v1 → v2 → v3 save sequence, live refresh of an
  already-open artifact, historical versions and hashes, truthful missing
  execution/review evidence, exact download, and reopening after the source
  file is deleted. A second pass proves live rename, two-step deletion,
  recoverable Trash, and Restore. Desktop 1440×900 and mobile 390×844 have no
  page overflow.
- An exact-version browser pass proves the Review surface shows version 3 plus
  its SHA, launches a brief containing the same immutable target ID, keeps the
  UI at “waiting for recorded evidence” when no model can produce findings,
  and has no horizontal overflow at 390×844.
- A packaged test-channel pass of this milestone remains required before these
  rows become `verified`.

## Previous milestone: stable shell and truthful composer

- Session tabs persist, reorder, expose draft/working/unread state, and close
  without deleting sessions.
- Collection and file tabs share one contextual strip; closing the active tab
  focuses its nearest neighbor and closing the final tab removes the pane.
- Context, work tabs, selected file, scroll state, and pane width remain scoped
  to project plus session.
- Desktop uses a split pane at 1100px and wider; tablet and mobile use one
  full-pane context view with a persistent Back action.
- The empty session remains blank and focuses the composer.
- Attach, model plus source, Plan/Act, and Send/Stop remain visible; only clear
  attachments, Terminal, preferences, and prompt history live in overflow.
- Missing-model setup is an inline row immediately above the composer.
- Inter Variable is bundled and app chrome routes through the canonical shared
  icon source.

### Local evidence

- 73 focused shell, state, composer, and token tests pass.
- Workspace `tsgo -b` and production Vite build pass.
- Browser walkthrough passes at 1440×900, 900×800, and 390×844.
- Test-channel package verification is required before these rows become
  `verified`.
